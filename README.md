# Produce Exchange
www.produceex.herokuapp.com

A community based application that helps neighbors trade homegrown fruits and vegetables. 


# Technology:
MEAN stack application utilizing: 
Mongo db and Mongoose
Express
Angular 
Node.js


# General approach :
I started by creating wireframes and the user story. After the user story was finished I build the basic skeleton of the app using Node.js and installed and imported all needed dependencies/modules (Express, Router, bodyParser, path, Mongoose and Angular). After I tested that Angular and all other dependencies were working I proceeded to integrate the Cloudinary API (to upload pictures) and its endpoints. In the next step I created the models using Mongo and Mongoose, then tested saving and retrieving data from the database. After all the parts were working I created the routes I would need for full CRUD functionality. The last part I worked on was the styling utilizing the Bootstrap library, Angular UI, and CSS. 
And finally I deployed to Heroku using mLab as my database service.


 # Wireframes & User Story: 
 I wanted to solve a problem that I encounter every summer. My garden always seems to grow too much of one thing and I'm always looking to share and trade my artichokes, blueberries and grapes.
